# wkwebview-local-resources
iOS project with a WKWebView that loads local resources, based on one of my SO answers.

### Currently supported:
* Local HTML, CSS and JS files
* Remote HTML, CSS and JS files (as requested by edon2005):
  1) downloading a zip & unzipping (Alamofire + Zip)
  2) Loading those unzipped files that are saved in /Documents/ in the WKWebView - HTML, CSS and JS

### Still to do:
* identical project for macOS
